# Hi, My name is Neil! 

## I'm currently a 23 year old student at the University of Toronto, completing my final semester of a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
#### I'm proficient in Python, with 5 years of experience, and have intermediate knowledge in Golang, Java, and JavaScript with 2 years of experience in each.

## Experience
I completed a year-long co-op working as a Backend Software Developer for [KOHO Financial](https://www.koho.ca/), as a part of the team responsible for creating the different subscription tiers offered by the company. I was mainly responsible for building internal tools, such as a script which assisted in backfilling user data to the new and/or revamped subscription tiers created by the team. I also gained experience in bugfixing and writing robust unit and integration tests, as well as best practices for writing clear and effective documentation. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at KOHO and built long-lasting relations with so many new people I otherwise never would have gotten to meet!

Previously, I have also worked part-time as a Coding Instructor for the company [Code Ninjas in Brampton, ON](https://www.codeninjas.com/brampton-south-west-on-ca) where I would guide young children through a program on learning to code mainly in JavaScript and a little bit of Python.

I have knowledge of Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, RabbitMQ, DataDog, Postman as well as many other applications and services.

## Past Projects

My most updated project is my [personal website/portfolio](https://neil-mehta.com). I built it using ReactJS and styled it using SCSS. This website is the best way to gain an understanding of my abilities, since I often update it with whatever new skills I learn. It's also all of my passions gathered into one place!

In order to expand on my full-stack skills, I have also recently built a (Proof of Concept) music streaming service I call Melodia, its a React App that utilizes Axios HTTP client to access Spotify API and play (snippets of) music from playlists belonging to the Spotify user. Unfortunately the project is still in development mode on SpotifyAPI, so its access is limited to test accounts only.

In my forays into Machine Learning, I've built a simple image segmenter using the k-Nearest Neighbours model to help me improve my artistic skills. Continuing my experience in ML, I've contributed to building a Multi-Layer Perceptron capable of predicting the city being spoken about by a person (a school project - the writeup for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/mchappyneil/csc311-final-project-report/blob/main/csc311challenge.pdf)).

During my co-op experience, I developed my knowledge of RESTful APIs and web development by creating my own "people-service" in Golang: a small API using basic HTML methods to communicate with a server that hosted "people".

In previous years, I've made a demo for a "Social Media Website" I call [LinkUp](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/LinkUp_Social_Media_Website.git). I created this project back in my senior year of High School as my final project for my Computer Science class, and then spent a while updating it as I went because it was something I was really proud of. But with how far I've come now, I look back at the project and see several things I could have done better from the start. It now mostly acts as a memento for myself, to remind me of where and how I started, and how far I've come - both as a developer and as a person.

When I was first learning how to use ReactJS, I built a [weather forecaster](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/weather_forecaster_final) that wrapped around the [OpenWeatherMap Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It's a very small, very simple project that I made just to get familiar with the major aspects of web development.

There are more projects I have completed, mainly for school, however due to potential Academic Offences (i.e., plagiarism) and Copyright Infringement, I have chosen to not display them on GitHub.

## More About Me

As I continue to grow and advance in my career, I am hoping to be able to work in biotechnology, developing AI or ML programs and/or platforms to provide us with deeper understanding into genetic and other types of illnesses and diseases.

I love playing both board and video games. A few years ago, I built [my very first desktop computer](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/zcJbt6), and I enjoyed every second of it - sometimes I think about dismantling it all just to build it again. I love to read, watch football (soccer), Formula One, and code!

Here's a list of my top 5 favourite (video) games of all time, ranked in no particular order:
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) üü´
- [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/) üê≤
- [Sanabi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562700/SANABI/) üåÜ
- [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/) üí∞ 
- [Mario Kart (Wii)](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Wii) üçÑ
