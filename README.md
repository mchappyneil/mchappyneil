# Hi, My name is Neil! 

## I'm currently a 22 year old student at the University of Toronto, completing my final year of a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
#### I'm proficient in Python, with 5 years of experience, and have intermediate knowledge in Golang, Java, and JavaScript with a year of experience in each.

## Experience
I completed a year-long co-op working as a Backend Software Developer for [KOHO Financial](https://www.koho.ca/), as a part of the team responsible for creating the different subscription tiers offered by the company. I was mainly responsible for building internal tools, such as a script which assisted in backfilling user data to the new and/or revamped subscription tiers created by the team. I also gained experience in bugfixing and writing robust unit and integration tests, as well as best practices for writing clear and effective documentation. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at KOHO and built long-lasting relations with so many new people I otherwise never would have gotten to meet!

Previously, I have also worked part-time as a Coding Instructor for the company [Code Ninjas in Brampton, ON](https://www.codeninjas.com/brampton-south-west-on-ca) where I would guide young children through a program on learning to code mainly in JavaScript and a little bit of Python.

I have knowledge of Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, RabbitMQ, DataDog, Postman as well as many other applications and libraries.

## Past Projects

My most recent project (and the one I update most consistently) is my [personal website/portfolio](https://neil-mehta.com). I built it from the ground up using ReactJS as a framework and styling it using SCSS. This website is the best way to gain an understanding of my abilities, since I often update it with whatever new skills I learn. It's also all of my passions gathered into one place!

During my co-op experience, I developed my knowledge of RESTful APIs and web development by creating my own "people-service" in Golang: a small API using basic HTML methods to communicate with a server that hosted "people".

In previous years, I've made a demo for a "Social Media Website" I call [```LinkUp```](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/LinkUp_Social_Media_Website.git). I created this project back in my senior year of High School as my final project for my Computer Science class, and then spent a while updating it as I went because it was something I was really proud of. But with how far I've come now, I look back at the project and see several things I could have done better from the start. It now mostly acts as a memento for myself, to remind me of where and how I started, and how far I've come - both as a developer and as a person.

When I was first learning how to use ReactJS, I built a [weather forecaster](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/weather_forecaster_final) that wrapped around the [OpenWeatherMap Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It's a very small, very simple project that I made just to get familiar with the major aspects of web development.

In my forays into Machine Learning, I've built a simple image segmenter using the k-Nearest Neighbours model and a Multi-Layer Perceptron capable of predicting the city being spoken about by a person.

There are more projects I have completed, mainly for school, however due to potential Academic Offences (i.e., plagiarism) and Copyright Infringement, I have chosen to not display them on GitHub.

## More About Me

As I continue to grow and advance in my career, I am hoping to be able to work in biotechnology, developing AI or ML programs and/or platforms to provide us with deeper understanding into genetic and other types of illnesses and diseases.

I love playing both board and video games. I recently built [my very first desktop computer](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/zcJbt6), and I enjoyed every second of it - sometimes I think about dismantling it all just to build it again. I love to read, watch football (soccer), and code!

Here's a list of my top 5 favourite (video) games of all time, ranked in no particular order:
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) 🟫
- [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/) 🐲
- [Sanabi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562700/SANABI/) 🌆
- [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/) 💰 
- [Mario Kart (Wii)](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Wii) 🍄
