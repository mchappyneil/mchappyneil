# Hi, My name is Neil! 

## I'm a 23 year old engineer, graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Science double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
#### I'm proficient in Python, Golang, Java, JavaScript, and other languages.

## Experience
Currently, I work for the Unviersity of Toronto part-time as a Mathematics Teaching Assistant, where I collaborate with professors to select weekly math topics to deliver workshops on for high school students, create and design slide decks in LaTeX for those workshops, and then deliver weekly interactive presentations to interested students.

I completed a year-long co-op working as a Backend Engineer for [KOHO Financial](https://www.koho.ca/), as a part of the team responsible for creating the different subscription tiers offered by the company. I was mainly responsible for building internal tools, such as a script which assisted in backfilling user data to the new and/or revamped subscription tiers created by the team. I also gained experience in bugfixing and writing robust unit and integration tests, as well as best practices for writing clear and effective documentation. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at KOHO and built long-lasting relations with so many new people I otherwise never would have gotten to meet!

Previously, I have also worked part-time as a Coding Instructor for the company [Code Ninjas in Brampton, ON](https://www.codeninjas.com/brampton-south-west-on-ca) where I would guide young children through a program on learning to code mainly in JavaScript and a little bit of Python.

I have knowledge of Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, RabbitMQ, DataDog, Postman as well as many other applications and services.

## Past Projects

My most updated project is my [personal website/portfolio](https://neil-mehta.com). I built it using ReactJS and styled it using SCSS. This website is the best way to gain an understanding of my abilities, since I often update it with whatever new skills I learn. It's also all of my passions gathered into one place!

As part of the CSC413 Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at the University of Toronto, I worked with a team to implement an [AI using enhanced CycleGAN architecture for image-to-image translation](https://github.com/mchappyneil/CSC413-GouGAN), focusing on converting real-world photographs into Impressionist-style paintings. By incorporating pre-trained discriminators as binary classifiers, we aimed to improve style fidelity and content accuracy, providing a robust approach to artistic style transfer.

In my other forays into Machine Learning, I've built a simple image segmenter using the k-Nearest Neighbours model to help me improve my artistic skills. Additionally, as part of the CSC311 Introduction to Machine Learning course at my university, I've contributed to building a Multi-Layer Perceptron capable of predicting the city being spoken about by a person (a school project - the writeup for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/mchappyneil/csc311-final-project-report/blob/main/csc311challenge.pdf)).

In previous years, I've made a demo for a "Social Media Website" I call [LinkUp](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/LinkUp_Social_Media_Website.git). I created this project back in my senior year of High School as my final project for my Computer Science class, and then spent a while updating it as I went because it was something I was really proud of. But with how far I've come now, I look back at the project and see several things I could have done better from the start. It now mostly acts as a memento for myself, to remind me of where and how I started, and how far I've come - both as a developer and as a person.

When I was first learning how to use ReactJS, I built a [weather forecaster](https://github.com/neil-mehta-code/weather_forecaster_final) that wrapped around the [OpenWeatherMap Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It's a very small, very simple project that I made just to get familiar with the major aspects of web development.

There are more projects I have completed, mainly for school, however due to potential Academic Offences (i.e., plagiarism) and Copyright Infringement, I have chosen to not display them publically on GitHub.

## More About Me

As I continue to grow and advance in my career, I am hoping to be able to work in healthcare technology, developing AI or ML programs and/or platforms to provide us with newfound and improved treatments and solutions for a variety of disabilities, illnesses, and diseases.

I love playing both board and video games. I'm a PC enthusiast, I love to read, watch sports like soccer and Formula One, and code! I also enjoy snowboarding, pursuing photography, and learning new things.

Here's a list of my top 5 favourite (video) games of all time, ranked in no particular order:
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) üü´
- [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/) üê≤
